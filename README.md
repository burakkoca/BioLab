# BioLab
Bioinformatic tool for sequence alignment, pattern match and motif search

This project provide various tools to analyze bioinformatics data like sequence alignment, pattern match and motif search. Each method has more than one algorithm and also you can compare the algorithms by using compare section. 

There is a new approximate pattern match approach also provided. The new algorithm is called A-BOM that is approximate version of BOM algorithm.

The project is published to public use and you can use all codes except A-BOM algorithm. A-BOM algorithm is avaliable in the project and it is free but if you want to use A-BOM algorithm please contact us.
